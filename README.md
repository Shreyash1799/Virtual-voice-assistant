The project was to build a program that helps the user to find, open any application in the computer or to search any information on the internet,sending the email just by voice or to type anything only by voice that can greet and do simple calculations and to tell weather by just one command.

It is activated when given the command “Hi Jarvis”

After receiving the command the assistant will greet you with 
Good morning, Good afternoon, Good evening or Good night depending on the time in computer.

We can give many commands like-
 
'open youtube'

'maximize'

'close the window' or 'close the app'

‘minimize’

'open google'

"tell me a joke"

'how are you'

'what can you do for me'
